# Curriculum Designer - Project Overview

## Problem Statement

A qualified English/Spanish teacher has transitioned from the Colombian school system to running an online teaching business. While she excels at teaching and loves curriculum design, she's spending excessive time creating "perfect" custom curricula for each student, particularly intermediate-level professionals (dentists, marketers, lawyers, accountants) who require personalized learning experiences.

## Current Business Model

- **Primary Offering**: 2 hours/week for 12 weeks at $600
- **Target Market**: Adult professionals seeking intermediate English lessons
- **Challenge**: Administrative overhead of curriculum creation doesn't generate direct revenue
- **Teacher Profile**: Masters-educated, highly qualified, transitioning from classroom to 1-on-1 online teaching

## Solution: Modular Curriculum Framework

### Core Concept
Create a modular system that allows spontaneous, high-quality curriculum assembly without extensive planning time. The teacher can select pre-designed modules based on student assessment and quickly construct effective 120-minute lessons.

### Framework Components

#### Main Activities (25-45 minutes each)
- Library of 20-100 categorized activities
- Ranked by difficulty, topic, learning style, profession
- Designed with flexible endpoints - can conclude naturally at any point
- Adaptable pacing based on individual student needs

#### Transition Activities (5-10 minutes each)
- Games and interactive quizzes
- Natural breaks between main topics
- Flexible timing for bathroom breaks or pace adjustments

### Key Benefits

1. **Quality Maintenance**: Pre-designed, tested activities ensure consistent educational value
2. **Time Efficiency**: Reduces curriculum planning from hours to minutes
3. **Customization**: Modular approach allows personalization without starting from scratch
4. **Scalability**: Framework grows with the business and can serve other educators
5. **Flexibility**: Activities adapt to student pace and engagement level
